I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography. I'm working in the <a href=https://web.uri.edu/hurricane-research/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hurricane Research Group</a> under the supervision of Dr. Isaac Ginis. My research focuses on improving the surface wind forecast during the landfall of hurricanes. As part of that project, I am developing a physics-based Hurricane Boundary Layer wind model that simulates the surface wind during landfall considering the frictional effect of local land cover characteristics.
