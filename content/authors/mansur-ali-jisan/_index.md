I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography. I'm working in the <a href=https://web.uri.edu/hurricane-research/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hurricane Research Group</a> under the advisement of <a href=https://web.uri.edu/gso/meet/isaac-ginis/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dr. Isaac Ginis</a>. My research focuses on improving the surface wind forecast during the landfall of hurricanes. As part of that project, I am developing a physics-based three-dimensional Hurricane Boundary Layer (HBL) wind model that simulates the surface wind during landfall considering the frictional effect of local land cover characteristics. A demonstration of the HBL model simulated surface wind for Hurricane Michael (2018) in 1km resolution can be viewd <a href=http://uri-hurricanes.info/HBL_Michael_TRIM.mp4 target=_blank rel=noopener> here</a>.
